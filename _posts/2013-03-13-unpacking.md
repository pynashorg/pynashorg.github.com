title: Expanding, Unpacking, or ... Splatting?

[Whatever you call it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2322355/proper-name-for-python-operator), a few wonderfully
useful features in Python are

* the ability to bind the items in an Iterable to local names: `a, b = 1, 2`
* or pass them as positional args to a function: `foo(*args)`,
* and similarly, to pass Dictionary items as keyword args: `foo(**kwargs)`.

And, with a similar syntax (`*args` and `**kwargs`), functions may be defined to accept an unknown number of
positional or keword arguments!

Unpacking into local names with `=`
---

Unpack any fixed length iterable into the same number of names:

    >>> a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
    >>> a, b, c
    (1, 2, 3)

    >>> d, e, f = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> d, e, f
    (1, 2, 3)

    >>> g, h, i = '123'
    >>> g, h, i
    ('1', '2', '3')

But, what happens with a dictionary since key iteration is not predictably ordered?

    >>> j, k, l = {'j': 1, 'k': 2, 'l': 3}
    >>> j, k, l
    ('k', 'j', 'l')

That's awesome! And, remember that [generators are iterables](http://pynash.org/2013/02/27/comprehensions-and-generators.html), too:

    >>> def gen():
    ...     for x in range(3):
    ...         yield x

    >>> m, n, o = gen()
    >>> m, n, o
    (0, 1, 2)

But don't forget that the number of names must equal the number of items being expanded:

    >>> blow, up = 3, 2, 1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: too many values to unpack

    >>> blow, up = 3,
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

* This restriction goes away in Python 3 with the awesome [PEP-3132: Extended Iterable Unpacking.](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/)

Unpacking with function arguments with `*args` and `**kwargs`
---

First, we'll need a function to play with and some values to unpack into it.

    >>> def foo(a, b, c): return c, b, a

    >>> tuple123 = (1, 2, 3)
    >>> list123 = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> str123 = '123'
    >>> dict123 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

Excellent; let's unpack! Everything from the previous section still applies, except that instead of the iterable
following `=`, it follows the `*` operator *(splat!)*.

    >>> foo(*tuple123)
    (3, 2, 1)
    >>> foo(*list123)
    (3, 2, 1)
    >>> foo(*str123)
    ('3', '2', '1')
    >>> foo(*dict123)
    ('b', 'c', 'a')

    >>> # and unpacking generators? of course.
    >>> foo(*gen())
    (2, 1, 0)

Let's revisit `foo(*dict123)` ... what if we wanted to apply the dictionary items as keyword arguments?

    >>> foo(**dict123)
    (3, 2, 1)

Nice! And, since we're passing values as keyword arguments, it doesn't matter that the iteration order is unpredictable.

Defining functions with `*args` and `**kwargs`
---

Now let's go the opposite direction. Instead of expanding arguments when calling functions, let's define functions
that collect positional arguments into an iterable and keyword arguments into a dictionary!

    >>> def bar(*args): return args
    >>> def baz(**kwargs): return kwargs

    >>> bar(1, 2, 3)
    (1, 2, 3)

    >>> baz(a=1, b=2, c=3)
    {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}

That's enough for now. Check out the official Python tutorial for [more on defining functions](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions).


Swapping Values
---

A common use for unpacking is the ability to neatly swap values between names, or within in a dictionary or list,
without a temporary variable:

    >>> a, b = 1, 2
    >>> a, b
    (1, 2)

    # now swap their values
    >>> a, b = b, a
    >>> a, b
    (2, 1)

    # swap positions in a list:
    >>> list123 = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> list123[0], list123[2] = list123[2], list123[0]
    >>> list123
    [3, 2, 1]

    # swap keys in a dictionary
    >>> dict123 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    >>> dict123['a'], dict123['c'] = dict123['c'], dict123['a']
    >>> dict123
    {'a': 3, 'c': 1, 'b': 2}

And that's all I've got for this week. With a little luck, next week I'll talk about slicing ... but PyCon 2013 is
right around the corner and it might inspire a completely different topic!
