        <p>Under general direction, the Systems Software Specialist II (SSS) modifies and maintains a complex, in-house software application that automates a neuroimaging analysis pipeline for a neuroscience research lab. This application interacts with multiple other interfaces including Redcap, ACCRE, and Vanderbilt University Imaging Institute’s (VUIIS) imaging servers, and relies on relational database structures. Because the package does not involve a comprehensive manual or GUI, this process requires in-depth knowledge of Python as well as the extensive network of tools the package connects with. The SSS ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place to keep personal identifying information and research data safe, secure, and backed up. He or she works with an interdisciplinary team of researchers to produce high quality scientific research publications. Competent to work at the highest technical level on all phases of application programming in a research setting.</p>

       <p>Close to 50m Americans move every year, and 3/4 (37m) are 'do-it-yourselfers'. Not because they want to do it themselves, but because they are price conscious and don't have an alternative in between begging friends to help or going through the hassle/cost of booking a traditional moving company.</p>

<p>Bellhops is a tech-based, on-demand platform for moving help that provides a national, branded workforce of college students to help you move easily and affordably. Serving 130+ cities and growing. We've created an automated hiring, managing, and scheduling system that allows our customers to get the help they need from our workforce of college students. We pair program, practice TDD, and learn something new every day.</p>

<p>We currently develop in Django, but we'd love to talk to any web developer who's eager to learn. We constantly rotate pair programming partners and love working with each other on creating new, exciting features. We'd love to meet another developer that we'd be excited to learn with. We develop with and contribute to open source software so candidates with open source contributions are especially desirable.</p>

<p>This position is based in our headquarters in Chattanooga, TN. The city is home to the first municipal gigabit network in the nation, and was described by Outside Magazine as the best outdoor city in the country.</p>
