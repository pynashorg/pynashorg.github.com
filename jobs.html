        <p>Quite possibly one of the nerdiest contract gigs in Nashville.  I'm looking for professional help in completing my utility set for players of Magic The Gathering Online.  Most players, like me, hate the fact that MTGO is a money sink.  With every expansion, you are required to pony up for cards to keep yourself competitive.  My utility set helps players use their card-buying budget more efficiently - for a small, monthly subscription fee.  I've already written most of the business logic.  I need help wiring up my payment processor, completing the free trial workflow, and launching the site on AWS.</p>

        <p>For more information please contact <a href="mailto:donrosszx@gmail.com">Don Ross</a> or view my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/don-ross/4/48a/243">LinkedIn Profile</a>.  I will also accept emails telling me what a dork I am for playing a silly card game in my 40s.  I know, I know.</p>

       <p>Close to 50m Americans move every year, and 3/4 (37m) are 'do-it-yourselfers'. Not because they want to do it themselves, but because they are price conscious and don't have an alternative in between begging friends to help or going through the hassle/cost of booking a traditional moving company.</p>

<p>Bellhops is a tech-based, on-demand platform for moving help that provides a national, branded workforce of college students to help you move easily and affordably. Serving 130+ cities and growing. We've created an automated hiring, managing, and scheduling system that allows our customers to get the help they need from our workforce of college students. We pair program, practice TDD, and learn something new every day.</p>

<p>We currently develop in Django, but we'd love to talk to any web developer who's eager to learn. We constantly rotate pair programming partners and love working with each other on creating new, exciting features. We'd love to meet another developer that we'd be excited to learn with. We develop with and contribute to open source software so candidates with open source contributions are especially desirable.</p>

<p>This position is based in our headquarters in Chattanooga, TN. The city is home to the first municipal gigabit network in the nation, and was described by Outside Magazine as the best outdoor city in the country.</p>
