title: Timing and Profiling in IPython

Timing and profiling code is all sorts of useful, and it's also just good ol' fashioned fun (and sometimes surprising!).
In this post, I'll introduce how to do the following through IPython magic functions:

* `%time` & `%timeit`: See how long a script takes to run (one time, or averaged over a bunch of runs).
* `%prun`: See how long it took each function in a script to run.
* `%lprun`: See how long it took each line in a function to run.
* `%mprun` & `%memit`: See how much memory a script uses (line-by-line, or averaged over a bunch of runs).

Installation & Setup
===

Please make sure you're running IPython 0.11 or greater. This post was authored against Python 2.7 and
IPython 0.13.1.

    $ pip install ipython
    $ ipython --version
    0.13.1

Most of the functionality we'll work with is included in the standard library, but if you're interested in line-by-line
or memory profiling, go ahead and run through this setup. First, install the following:

    $ pip install line-profiler
    $ pip install psutil
    $ pip install memory_profiler

Next, create an IPython profile and extensions directory where we'll configure a couple of missing magic functions:

    $ ipython profile create
    [ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: u'/Users/tsclausing/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py'

    $ mkdir ~/.ipython/extensions/

Create the following IPython extention files with the contents below to define the magic functions:

`~/.ipython/extensions/line_profiler_ext.py`

    import line_profiler

    def load_ipython_extension(ip):
        ip.define_magic('lprun', line_profiler.magic_lprun)

`~/.ipython/extensions/memory_profiler_ext.py`

    import memory_profiler

    def load_ipython_extension(ip):
        ip.define_magic('memit', memory_profiler.magic_memit)
        ip.define_magic('mprun', memory_profiler.magic_mprun)

Finally, register the extension modules you just created with the default IPython profile we made earlier:

Edit `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`, search for, **uncomment**, and modify these lists to include:

    c.TerminalIPythonApp.extensions = [
        'line_profiler_ext',
        'memory_profiler_ext',
    ]
    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [
        'line_profiler_ext',
        'memory_profiler_ext',
    ]

And that's it! We're ready to time and profile to our hearts content. Start `ipython` and test for the following:

    $ ipython
    Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 20 2012, 16:23:33)
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Time Profiling
===

Time profiling does exactly what it sounds like - it tells you how much time it took to execute a script, which may be
a simple one-liner or a whole module.

%time
---

See how long it takes a script to run.

    In [7]: %time {1 for i in xrange(10*1000000)}
    CPU times: user 0.72 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 0.88 s
    Wall time: 0.75 s

%timeit
---

See how long a script takes to run averaged over multiple runs.

    In [8]: %timeit 10*1000000
    10000000 loops, best of 3: 38.2 ns per loop

`%timeit` will limit the number of runs depending on how long the script takes to execute. Keep in mind that the
`timeit` module in the standard library *does not* do this by default, so timing long running scripts that way
may leave you waiting forever.

The number of runs may be set with with `-n 1000`, for example, which will limit `%timeit` to a thousand iterations,
like this:

    In [9]: %timeit -n 1000 10*1000000
    1000 loops, best of 3: 67 ns per loop

Also note that the run-time reported will vary more when limited to fewer loops.

%prun
---

See how long it took each function in a script to run.

    In [10]: from time import sleep

    In [11]: def foo(): sleep(1)

    In [12]: def bar(): sleep(2)

    In [13]: def baz(): foo(), bar()

    In [14]: %prun baz()
    7 function calls in 3.001 seconds

    Ordered by: internal time

    ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
         2    3.001    1.500    3.001    1.500 {time.sleep}
         1    0.000    0.000    3.001    3.001 <ipython-input-17-c32ce4852c7d>:1(baz)

         1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}


%lprun
---
See how long it took each line in a function to run.

Create and edit a new module named `foo.py` in the same directory where you started IPython. Paste the following code
in the file and jump back to IPython.

    def foo(n):
        phrase = 'repeat me'
        pmul = phrase * n
        pjoi = ''.join([phrase for x in xrange(n)])
        pinc = ''
        for x in xrange(n):
            pinc += phrase
        del pmul, pjoi, pinc

Import the function and profile it line by line with `%lprun`. Functions to profile this way must be passed by name with
`-f`.

    In [15]: from foo import foo

    In [16]: %lprun -f foo foo(100000)
    Timer unit: 1e-06 s

    File: foo.py
    Function: foo at line 1
    Total time: 0.301032 s

    Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
    ==============================================================
         1                                           def foo(n):
         2         1            3      3.0      0.0      phrase = 'repeat me'
         3         1          185    185.0      0.1      pmul = phrase * n
         4    100001        97590      1.0     32.4      pjoi = ''.join([phrase for x in xrange(n)])
         5         1            4      4.0      0.0      pinc = ''
         6    100001        90133      0.9     29.9      for x in xrange(n):
         7    100000       112935      1.1     37.5          pinc += phrase
         8         1          182    182.0      0.1      del pmul, pjoi, pinc

Memory Profiling
===

%mprun
---

See how much memory a script uses line by line.  Let's take a look at the same `foo()` function that we profiled with
`%lprun` - except this time we're interested in incremental memory usage and not execution time.

    In [17]: %mprun -f foo foo(100000)
    Filename: foo.py

    Line #    Mem usage    Increment   Line Contents
    ================================================
         1    20.590 MB     0.000 MB   def foo(n):
         2    20.590 MB     0.000 MB       phrase = 'repeat me'
         3    21.445 MB     0.855 MB       pmul = phrase * n
         4    25.020 MB     3.574 MB       pjoi = ''.join([phrase for x in xrange(n)])
         5    25.020 MB     0.000 MB       pinc = ''
         6    43.594 MB    18.574 MB       for x in xrange(n):
         7    43.594 MB     0.000 MB           pinc += phrase
         8    41.102 MB    -2.492 MB       del pmul, pjoi, pinc

%memit
---

See how much memory a script uses overall. `%memit` works a lot like `%timeit` except that the number of iterations is
set with `-r` instead of `-n`.

    In [18]: %memit -r 3 [x for x in xrange(1000000)]
    maximum of 3: 75.320312 MB per loop

Please leave other tips & tools in the comments below. I remember a while back seeing a video from someone who built a
profiling visualization in matplotlib, but I haven't been able to dig it up. If you find it, please post it here, too!
