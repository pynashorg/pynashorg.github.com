We are in the process of getting setup so community members can add blog posts. If all goes according to plan, 
our goal is to have at least 5 people sign up as writers. Each writier will write one post per week. The rules for each post 
are as follows, it must be at least 100 words in length and have at least 4 lines of code. The first writer
to miss their day buys lunch for the other writers at our next PyNash lunch.

So keep an eye out for our soon to be competing content creators.

thanks,
Matt
