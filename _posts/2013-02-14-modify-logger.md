##Modify Logger Output

I'm a fan of the internal [Python logging module](http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html) and recently I've run into the need to remove some information from all log output in a system at work, and a custom Handler or a Filter just wouldn't do.

Fortunately it's rather easy to modify the behavior of logging.Logger.

	>>> import logging
	>>> import sys
	>>> class CustomLogger(logging.getLoggerClass()):
	. . .		def makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, extra=None):
	. . .			msg += ' adding stuff'
	. . .			return super(CustomLogger, self).makeRecord(name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=func, extra=extra)
	. . .
	>>> logger = CustomLogger(__name__)
	>>> handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
	>>> logger.addHandler(handler)
	>>> logger.error('Halp')
	Halp adding stuff
	>>>

Notice we subclass from logging.getLoggerClass() as this will return the most recently modified instance of Logger -- otherwise the base Logger class; that's important if you want to allow other libraries or the framework you may be using, to also modify its behavior.

I'll let this be a teaser. Next post will be a tutorial type post on the logging module in Python -- to warm you up a bit to the concept, posts afterwards will hack up logging in ever useful ways.
