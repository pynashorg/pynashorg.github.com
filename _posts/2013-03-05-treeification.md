*Thanks to Jeremy Holland for giving this problem its proper name.*

When the lights finally go out and civilization falls apart,
and a single can of Spam trades for a whole box of .45 rounds,
the Southeastern Conference will need to keep some land routes open
so its football teams can meet for games.

The SEC is uniquely positioned to form a power base post-civilization,
as its alumni are numerous, geographically concentrated,
fanatical, and pretty well armed on average.
Still, holding territory may prove costly.
It might be best
to focus on the minimum amount of road needed
to bring teams together.

With the addition of Missouri this fall, the SEC will have 14 teams:

What we need is the minimum road network
that connects all these stadiums.

This is a classic graph problem.


## Graphs are everywhere

A [<dfn>graph</dfn>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29)
is just a set of objects, called vertices,
any two of which are either connected by an edge or not.
When you draw one on paper, it looks like one of these:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/blog-content/many-graphs.png">
</figure>

But they&rsquo;re not just silly math pictures.
Interesting real-world relationships can be seen as graphs.

* The people of Nashville are the vertices of a graph,
  where edges connect acquaintances.

* A DOM document is a graph,
  with edges connecting each node to its parent.

* All the actors in IMDB are the vertices of a graph,
  with edges connecting actors who have appeared in a movie together.
  (Or, all the movies are vertices, connected by common actors.
  A different graph from the same data.)

* All the possible snapshots of a game of chess form an enormous graph,
  with edges connecting each snapshot with those showing how it might
  look after the next move.

Food webs, economies, maps, family trees, class hierarchies,
the Internet&mdash;it&rsquo;s all graphs.
So what? Why do we care?
Because there are some powerful practical algorithms
that can be applied to *all* graphs.

* [Depth-first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
  is a simple algorithm for finding a path from one vertex to another.

* [Breadth-first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
  finds the shortest path.
  Either algorithm can also be used with minor changes
  to figure out if a graph contains any cycles.

* [Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
  finds the lowest-cost path
  from one node to another in a graph
  where each edge is labeled with a cost.

And if you&rsquo;re staring down the barrel of total societal collapse
and longing for the simple pleasures of the gridiron,
you might find [Prim&rsquo;s algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) useful.
It finds a *minimum spanning tree*: that is,
the lowest-cost subgraph of a labeled graph
that still connects all the vertices.


## The plan

Prim&rsquo;s algorithm is very simple. It builds the optimal network one edge at a time.

1. Start with one vertex (any vertex, doesn&rsquo;t matter) and no edges.
2. Find the cheapest edge connecting any already-reached vertex to any not-yet-reached vertex.
3. Add that edge and the new vertex to the network.
4. If all vertices have been reached, you&rsquo;re done. Otherwise go back to step 2.

That&rsquo;s it. Wikipedia gives a simple proof, in case you aren&rsquo;t convinced that
[this algorithm always gives a correct answer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm#Proof_of_correctness)


## The code

[(Full source.)](https://gist.github.com/jorendorff/5088585)

Start with delicious raw data.

    raw_data = [
        ("Florida",  "Gainesville, FL", "Ben Hill Griffin Stadium", 29.6500583, -82.3487493),
        ("Georgia",  "Athens, GA",      "Sanford Stadium",          33.9497366, -83.3733819),
        ("Kentucky", "Lexington, KY",   "Commonwealth Stadium",     38.0220905, -84.5053408),
        ("Missouri", "Columbia, MO",    "Faurot Field",             38.9359174, -92.3334619),
        ...
    ]

    coordinates_by_name = {uni: (lat, long) for uni, _, _, lat, long in raw_data}

Stir in a formula for the distance between two points on the globe.

    # Radius of the earth in miles.
    earth_radius = 3956.6

    def distance(u1, u2):
        return earth_radius * arclen(coordinates_by_name[u1], coordinates_by_name[u2])

    # Actual driving distance is 345 miles; as the crow flies, 302.9.
    assert 300 < distance("Florida", "Georgia") < 305

And now the main event. Note that the code below works for any distance function
you care to provide; it doesn't have to be based on geographic distances.

    def treeify(vertices, distanceFn):
        """ Return a list of triples (distance, v1, v2), the edges of a minimum spanning tree. """

        # We're going to build a tree. It is initially empty.
        tree_edges = []

        # We'll use two sets. `outside` holds all vertices we cannot reach yet,
        # which initially is all of them.
        outside = set(vertices)

        # `inside` holds all vertices we can reach, and we'll begin by putting one
        # vertex in there. It doesn't matter which one. This is the seed from which
        # our tree will grow.
        seed = outside.pop()
        inside = {seed}

        # We use `edges` to select which edge to add next. Since the algorithm has
        # us repeatedly choosing the cheapest edge, we'll use a heap. Initially it
        # contains all edges leading out from `seed`.
        edges = []
        for v in outside:
            heapq.heappush(edges, (distanceFn(seed, v), seed, v))

        # When no vertices are left outside the tree, we'll be done.
        while outside:
            # Choose the cheapest edge leading from an `inside` vertex that we
            # haven't already considered.
            new_edge = d, x, y = heapq.heappop(edges)

            # Now this edge might actually connect two inside vertices, in which
            # case we'll just discard it and keep going. We know that `x` at least
            # is inside, since we've only added edges leading from inside vertices.
            assert x in inside
            if y in outside:
                # We have selected the cheapest edge, as required by the algorithm.
                # Add it to the tree, move `y` from `outside` to `inside`, and add
                # to `edges` all the edges leading from `y` to outside nodes.
                tree_edges.append(new_edge)
                outside.remove(y)
                inside.add(y)
                for w in outside:
                    heapq.heappush(edges, (distanceFn(y, w), y, w))

        return tree_edges

Using this function on the SEC data set is a piece of cake:

    import sec, pprint
    result = treeify(sec.names, sec.distance)
    pprint.pprint(result)

The resulting map:

This tree requires the SEC to hold 2,359 miles of road.

## Can we do better?

We made one unnecessary assumption here: namely,
that every path had to be a straight line
beginning at one stadium and ending at another.

Next week I&rsquo;ll remove that assumption
and see if we can find an even better SEC road network.
See you then.

P.S. Kudos to the NCAA on the long-overdue
[treeification](http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099187/ncaa-presidents-approve-four-team-college-football-playoff-beginning-2014)
of the college football postseason.
